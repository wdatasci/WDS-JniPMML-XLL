# TODOs, version 0.5.0

Outstanding items and items for the next version:
<ul>
<li>Additional documentation and expanded test suite.</li>
<li>Date and DateTime datatypes are not fully implemented.  They are preliminarily setup to pass as doubles, but wrangling of string
values, detection via cell information, and testing needs to be performed.</li>
<li>The object cache and Handle/Tag handlers could be written better.</li>
<li>Additional HDF5 utilities, such as returning a layout and querying an element when an HDF5 is used like a memory mapped file.</li>
<li>Expanded VBA library.</li>
</ul>

An interesting thought or wish list:
<ul>
<li>External memory mapped files, using the DBB wrangler.</li>
<li>A parallel assembly for calling from MSSQLServer.</li>
</ul>
