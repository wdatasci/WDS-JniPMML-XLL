## JniPMML-Java 

The initial design of JniPMML-Java is to wrap jpmml into a single jar which can be called
from Excel/C# via JNICode.  However, it is a standalone that can be used with command line calls.
It therefore has wranglers for text and HDF5 files in addition to the ByteBuffers for interacting
with C#.
