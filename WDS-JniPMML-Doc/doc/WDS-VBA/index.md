## WDS-VBA

The WDS-VBA code is a collection of VBA macros that can be included in Excel workbooks and there 
are C#/VB macros accessibly through the ribbon to wrangle them in and out of workbooks as needed.

There is a necessity for at least the WDSCore macro for adding ExcelDna Intellisense capabilities.
