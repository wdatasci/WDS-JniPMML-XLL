## WDS-Java

General utilitities that independent of JniPMML code.  To simplify assemblies and jars, this code is 
included in the larger projects, but is also compiled as a stand alone.

On the java side, there is a separate WDS-00.00.00.jar generated but it is pulled into a shaded jar
so that only one WDS-JniPMML-00.00.00.jar needs to be used in practice.
