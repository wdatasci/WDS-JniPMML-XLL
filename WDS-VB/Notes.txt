Quick notes:  

The usual Visual Studio VB "My Project" location for properties is renames "Properties".  
However, unlike usual folders, Visual Studio may not present an Expand/Collapse icon.   
In Solution Explorer, use the "Show Files" toggle to view contents.

Because of some Public/Private conflicts with ExcelDna exports, the default VS provided
Settings and Resources constructors and handlers are not used.  Rebuilding the Designer.vb
files may undo this.
